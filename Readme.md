## About

This project is my first attempt at creating and publishing a complete website. I've worked in digital experiences my entire career, mostly as an analyst

<a href="cecileconsulting.site" target="blank">Cécile Consulting</a> is a <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="blank">Bootstrap website</a>.
The design and functionality were heavily borrowed from the <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/impact-bootstrap-business-website-template/" target="blank">Impact template</a> created by <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/" target="blank">BootstrapMade</a>.

I trimmed the downloadable template down to these two pages, and gave it a design overhaul.

The email form is not functional upon this initial deployment (2/20/2024).

I used DALL-E to generate the logo, and then I used other online tools to develop the color palette.
