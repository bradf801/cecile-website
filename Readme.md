# My Project - Cécile Consulting

## About

<a href="https://www.cecileconsulting.site" target="blank">Cécile Consulting</a> is a super simple website built to give more visibility to Cécile's consulting services in the healthcare industry.

It's built using <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/" target="blank">Bootstrap</a>. The structure and functionality were mostly borrowed from the <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/impact-bootstrap-business-website-template/" target="blank">Impact template</a> created by <a href="https://bootstrapmade.com/" target="blank">BootstrapMade</a>.

This project was intended to serve two purposes:

1) **Professional**: To support Cécile, who is an excellent healthcare marketing professional.
2) **Educational**: Undertake the process of building and publishing a website without using Wordpress, Squarespace, etc. in order to bolster my understanding of how web-based products are built.

## Education

### Gen AI

I have a limited background in development, and a  deep interest in Gen AI. With the emergence of tools like ChatGPT, I decided it was time for me to experiment with the power of gen AI tools.

The experience was quite eye-opening. From explorative queries like:
> "Provide a very brief overview of what the Bootstrap library is for front-end web development"

and
> "What are the limitations of the Bootstrap framework compared to other popular frameworks?"

To more specific queries like:
> "What are the most basic steps I need to take in order to deploy my GitHub project to the internet using a Hover domain that I already own using GitHub Pages?"

I was able to use ChatGPT 4 to fill in gaps and dig further whenever I became curious about something, or ran into more complicated issues. Although Gen AI doesn't replace years of experience and education, I feel like the level of personalization that ChatGPT 4 enables is an educational cheat code.

Additionally, I used DALL-E to generate the logo, and then I used other online tools to develop the color palette. Really cool stuff.

### Dev Environment

I learned how to how to setup and more effectively use VSCode and GitHub. I used both tools at a very basic level for this project, but the experience gave me a foundation for understanding how more complex projects are built.

### HTML + CSS | Bootstrap

I've worked in digital analytics for years and have developed a basic understanding of how the frontend of a website works. This was a fun opportunity for me to go deeper into the elements of basic design and functionality provided by the Bootstrap framework.

### Deploying Static Websites

This process was new to me. I used ChatGPT and some online documentation proviced by GitHub and Hover to understand this process. It turned out to be way more straightforward than I thought it would. And, as far as I can tell, this website hasn't gone down once since it launched.

## Next Steps

### Email Form

As of right now (2/22/2024) the email form doesn't work. This is my next deep dive, and looks to be somewhat daunting considering I don't know much about PHP/AJAX, server-side processing, etc.

### Maintenance

I plan to learn more about library management and updates so that I can make sure the code doesn't become outdated. the website and make any necessary changes as they arise.
